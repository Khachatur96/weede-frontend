            country, whichever is higher. Our Services are intended exclusively

            we utilize a third-party age verification system that may involve
            collecting user photo IDs and cross-checking identities against
            various databases. Once age verification is complete, all related
            data is retained for a maximum of 30 days before being securely
            deleted. You are prohibited from using the products for any unlawful
            or unauthorized purpose, and must not violate any laws applicable in

            LLC&apos;s principal place of business is located, without regard to

            these fees in whole or in part based on a reasoned decision. The
            parties agree that the arbitrator may award attorneys&apos; fees

            damages may not be awarded, and each party waives any right to seek
